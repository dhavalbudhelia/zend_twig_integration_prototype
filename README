The purpose of this prototype application is to demonstrate integration between Zend-Framework and the Twig.

Zend Framework is by default shipped with the Zend_View, here I have tried to create my own Core View and Extend it 
with the Abstract Zend View to inject Twig functionality into Zend Framework.
This is very basic level integration. It can further be enhanced by creating nested Twig Templates.
The Code is very well organised and clearly separates Business and Presentation Logic.
If I have to write it again, I will try to make it more flexible in terms of setting different/suitable Twig Layouts.
i.e. I may create base layout and extends it into several sub layouts, and explore the real power and flexibility of 
Twig Template Engine.
